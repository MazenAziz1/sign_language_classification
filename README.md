# sign_language_classification
This project is all about training a CNN model on dataset exhibit labelled images for american sign language that is found on kaggle.
This journey would help you a lot to look more closely at some phases of CNN models while working on most of image classification projects like convolution, pooling and dense layers.
# Required libraries
+ Numpy
+ Pandas
+ Matplotlib
+ seaborn
+ Itertools
+ Tensorflow
+ keras
+ Sklearn
# About the dataset
[sign language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset is presented here and follows the same CSV format with labels and pixel values in single rows. The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion), 784 total pixels per sample.
# project implementation
+ import necessary libraries
+ load dataset
+ visualize frequency of the labels
+ reshape image sizes and encode the labels
+ create CNN model
+ augment data
+ train model
+ plot the results
# Why this project is noteworthy?
Implementation of this project applying whatever algorithm you prefer could be the stepping stone to the world of deep learning especially CNN models. Besides, the familiarity of this dataset will really motivate you to explore more challenges later.
